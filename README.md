# React-Based-Login-Page
 **A fancy, efficient, and modular login page for React-based webapps.**
 
- Each button, input field, status, and form itself is completely modular and can be applied in many different scenarios throughout a web-app experience.

- Uses a simple Nodemon server to "process" API requests using Express, and it sends back a single-digit response code to tell the front-end which status to display. 

- Uses Tailwind CSS to simplify some CSS creation and deployment.
